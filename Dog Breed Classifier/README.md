# **Project Title: City Dog Show - Python Image Classification**

**Project Description:**
Immerse yourself in the world of image classification for a citywide dog show, leveraging your Python programming skills to enhance the contestant registration process. In this project, you will utilize an existing image classifier to distinguish between dog and non-dog images, providing invaluable support to the organizing committee. Your primary focus will be on the application of Python tools rather than the creation of the classifier itself.

**Project Goal:**
Enhance your programming proficiency in Python by addressing the following key tasks:
1. Identify the most effective image classification algorithm for distinguishing between "dogs" and "not dogs."
2. Evaluate the chosen algorithm's performance in correctly identifying the breed of dogs.
3. Measure the execution time of each algorithm, understanding the trade-off between accuracy and runtime.

**Project Tasks:**
- Utilize a pre-built classifier function provided in the 'classifier.py' file, incorporating three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet).
- Assess and compare the performance of each architecture in classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs."
- Examine the ability of the chosen algorithm to accurately identify the breed of dogs, considering the challenge of similar-looking breeds.
- Time the execution of each algorithm, considering the computational resources required for optimal performance.

**Important Notes:**
- Leverage the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, trained on the ImageNet dataset, for image classification tasks.
- Focus on the provided 'classifier.py' and 'test_classifier.py' files for implementing Python solutions.
- Acknowledge that certain dog breeds may appear similar, affecting the algorithm's ability to distinguish between them.

**Project Workflow:**
1. **Command Line Arguments:** Explore and understand command line arguments using Python, allowing for flexible execution of the image classification tasks.
2. **Mutable Data Types and Functions:** Familiarize yourself with mutable data types and functions, crucial components for efficient Python programming.
3. **Creating Pet Image Labels:** Develop a systematic approach to creating and managing pet image labels, facilitating streamlined classification processes.
4. **Classifying Images:** Implement the image classification process using the pre-built classifier function, analyzing the performance of each architecture.
5. **Classifying Labels as Dogs:** Evaluate the classification results, focusing on accurately identifying images as either "dogs" or "not dogs."
6. **Calculating Results:** Apply Python to calculate and interpret the results, considering both accuracy and runtime.
7. **Printing Results:** Develop a user-friendly output, presenting the classification results in a clear and organized manner.
8. **Classify Uploaded Images:** Extend the application by allowing users to classify newly uploaded images, demonstrating the versatility of your Python solution.
9. **Final Results:** Summarize and present your findings, showcasing the effectiveness of the chosen image classification algorithm in the context of the city dog show.
