# **Project Title: Deep Learning Image Classifier Application to Recognize Different Species of Flower**

**Short Description:**
Embark on a comprehensive journey of developing an innovative image classification application using deep learning techniques. This two-part project provides a hands-on experience in implementing a sophisticated image classifier with PyTorch in a Jupyter notebook, followed by the conversion of the trained model into a command-line application. Your efforts will culminate in the creation of two essential Python scripts, 'train.py' and 'predict.py,' each serving a distinct purpose in the training and utilization of the image classifier.

**Tools and Tech Stack:**
- **Jupyter Notebook with GPU:** Leverage the power of GPU-accelerated computation in a Jupyter notebook to develop and fine-tune your image classifier with PyTorch. Ensure that your implementation aligns with the project rubric, emphasizing the importance of original code and avoiding plagiarism.
- **PyTorch and Deep Learning Frameworks:** Dive into the realm of deep learning by utilizing PyTorch and other frameworks to build and train your image classifier. Develop a keen understanding of model architectures, optimization strategies, and validation techniques.
- **Command-Line Application:** Transition seamlessly from the notebook environment to a command-line application. Craft 'train.py' to train a new network on a dataset and save the model checkpoint, and 'predict.py' to predict the class for an input image using the trained network.
- **Argparse Module:** Enhance the user experience by implementing the argparse module from the standard library, facilitating easy and intuitive command-line inputs for both training and prediction scripts.

**Skills:**
- **Deep Learning Mastery:** Hone your skills in developing and training deep neural networks for image classification, ensuring your model achieves high accuracy and performance.
- **Script Development:** Showcase your coding proficiency by creating two essential Python scripts ('train.py' and 'predict.py') that form the backbone of your image classification application.
- **Command-Line Integration:** Demonstrate your ability to translate complex deep learning models into user-friendly, command-line applications, extending the accessibility of your solution beyond the development environment.
- **Argparse Implementation:** Illustrate your expertise in leveraging the argparse module to seamlessly handle command-line inputs, providing users with a straightforward and efficient means of interacting with your application.

Take the next step in your journey as a software developer by immersing yourself in the exciting world of deep learning and practical application development. Build an image classification application that not only meets project specifications but also sets the stage for future advancements in AI-driven solutions. Best of luck with your project!
