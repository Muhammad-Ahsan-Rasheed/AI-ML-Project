# **Project Title: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited on Amazon SageMaker**

**Project Overview:**
In this project, you'll leverage your skills as a Machine Learning Engineer to build an image classification model for Scones Unlimited, a scone-delivery-focused logistics company. The objective is to develop a model that can automatically identify the type of vehicle delivery drivers are using, aiding in optimizing routing for delivery professionals with bicycles and motorcycles. Your role involves creating a scalable and safe model that can be seamlessly integrated into the company's operations.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Image Classification Model:** Build an image classification model capable of distinguishing between bicycles and motorcycles.
- **AWS SageMaker Deployment:** Utilize AWS SageMaker to deploy and manage the image classification model.
- **AWS Lambda Functions:** Implement AWS Lambda functions to support additional services.
- **AWS Step Functions:** Compose the image classification model and services into an event-driven application using AWS Step Functions.
- **Scalability and Monitoring:** Ensure that the model can scale to meet demand and incorporate safeguards for monitoring and controlling drift or degraded performance.

**Project Steps Overview:**
1. **Step 1: Data Staging**
   - Prepare and stage the data for model training.
   - Ensure data quality and suitability for the image classification task.

2. **Step 2: Model Training and Deployment**
   - Train the image classification model using AWS SageMaker.
   - Deploy the trained model to make it accessible for other teams.

3. **Step 3: Lambdas and Step Function Workflow**
   - Implement AWS Lambda functions to support additional services.
   - Use AWS Step Functions to compose the model and services into an event-driven application.

4. **Step 4: Testing and Evaluation**
   - Test the deployed model and services.
   - Evaluate the performance and accuracy of the image classification model.

5. **Step 5: Optional Challenge**
   - Take on an optional challenge to further enhance your project, demonstrating additional skills and creativity.

6. **Step 6: Cleanup Cloud Resources**
   - Conduct resource cleanup to ensure efficient use of cloud resources.

**Project Submission:**
Submit your project as a Git repository in a Zip file or GitHub repository, encompassing all the necessary files and documentation. Ensure your submission includes a comprehensive demonstration of your ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
