# **Project Title: Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media**

**Project Overview:**
In this project, you will leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a landmark classifier. The objective is to predict the location of an image based on the landmarks depicted within it. This project addresses the challenge of associating location data with photos lacking metadata, leading to enhanced features like automatic tag suggestions and photo organization for an enriched user experience.

**Project Steps:**

**1. Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch):**
   - Visualize the dataset and preprocess it for training.
   - Design a CNN from scratch for landmark classification.
   - Discuss decisions on data processing and network architecture.
   - Export the best-trained network using Torch Script.

**2. Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning):**
   - Explore different pre-trained models and select one for transfer learning.
   - Train and test the transfer-learned network for landmark classification.
   - Explain the rationale behind choosing the pre-trained network.
   - Export the best transfer learning solution using Torch Script.

**3. Deploy your algorithm in an app:**
   - Utilize your best model to create a user-friendly app for landmark prediction.
   - Test the model within the app and reflect on its strengths and weaknesses.

**Project Evaluation:**
Your project will be evaluated against the project rubric, covering aspects such as dataset visualization, model creation, transfer learning, app deployment, and overall project completeness. Ensure that your project meets all criteria outlined in the rubric for successful completion.

**Submission Instructions:**
At the end of the 'app.ipynb' notebook, follow the provided instructions to generate an archive file (e.g., 'submission_2022-03-31T00h55m.tar.gz') containing all your notebooks and code. If you worked in the Project Workspace, download the file from the workspace. If you worked locally, the file will already be on your machine. Visit the Project Submission page and submit the generated file for review.

Embark on this comprehensive project to showcase your proficiency in CNNs, transfer learning, and app deployment, contributing to the development of a landmark classification system for social media applications. Good luck with your landmark classifier project!
